# My BetterDiscord plugins
Repository, containing all of my created Discord plugins for BetterDiscord.  
More plugins will be added in the future.

## Why?
I wanted to create a snappy user experience for my Discord client and usage of some of the popular plugins makes Discord feel sluggish. That's why I decided to recreate most of the plugins I used, using my own plugin library.  
This allows me to create plugins that are much more performant and have a smaller footprint than the original plugins.  
This repository also serves as a way to check updates for my plugins.

## Installation
1. Download [the plugin library](https://prevter.github.io/bd-plugins/plugins/0PrevLib.plugin.js) and place it in your BetterDiscord plugins folder.
2. Download the plugins you want from the [plugins folder](https://github.com/Prevter/bd-plugins/tree/main/plugins) and place them in your BetterDiscord plugins folder.
3. Enable the plugins in BetterDiscord settings.

## Plugins
| Plugin | Description |

## Updating
By default, plugins will automatically check for updates every 4 hours. You can change the time in library settings, or disable it completely.  
When an update is available, an alert will be shown, asking you to update the plugin.
