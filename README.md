# My BetterDiscord plugins
Repository, containing all of my created Discord plugins for BetterDiscord.  
More plugins will be added in the future.

## Why?
I wanted to create a snappy user experience for my Discord client and usage of some of the popular plugins makes Discord feel sluggish. That's why I decided to recreate most of the plugins I used, using my own plugin library.  
This allows me to create plugins that are much more performant and have a smaller footprint than the original plugins.  
This repository also serves as a way to check updates for my plugins.

## Installation
1. Download [the plugin library](https://prevter.github.io/bd-plugins/plugins/0PrevLib.plugin.js) and place it in your BetterDiscord plugins folder. (Do not enable it in BetterDiscord settings!)
2. Download the plugins you want from the [plugins folder](https://github.com/Prevter/bd-plugins/tree/main/plugins) and place them in your BetterDiscord plugins folder.
3. Enable the plugins in BetterDiscord settings.

## Plugins
| Plugin | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [PrevLib](https://prevter.github.io/bd-plugins/plugins/0PrevLib.plugin.js) | Plugin library, required for all of my plugins. |
| [TurboStream](https://prevter.github.io/bd-plugins/plugins/TurboStream.plugin.js) | Enables streaming in 1080p 60fps. (Fake nitro) |

## Updating
I'm currently working on a way to automatically update plugins, but for now you'll have to manually update them by downloading the latest version of the plugin.
